# netlify.toml

# 1) Proxy every path to your Shopify store:
[[redirects]]
  from     = "/*"
  to       = "https://www.yummypooch.com/:splat"
  status   = 200    # "200" â†’ proxy rather than redirect
  force    = true   # override any existing content

# 2) Override any frame-busting headers so Adalo can embed in its Web View:
[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Frame-Options = "ALLOWALL"
    # (optionally) relax CSP if you run into frame-ancestor issues:
    Content-Security-Policy = "frame-ancestors *;"
